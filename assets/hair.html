      <h3>Hair & Make-up Crew</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Hair and Makeup Crew! We design, prepare, and implement hair and makeup plots for every show. You will be required to run each dress rehearsal and show. We have meetings in PA-101. If you join this crew, for hair, you can expect to learn how to braid, curl, tease, put on wigs, construct wigs, and style wigs. No prior experience in these fields is required. Furthermore, on makeup crew, you will learn how to apply blush, apply foundation, apply eye shadow, create old age, apply contour, and apply the other components of basic stage makeup. No prior experience in these fields is required. Some of our previous work from past shows is displayed below. We look forward to making magic with you soon!</p>
